Solution to code sample problem given to me by Greenway Health.

When running in an IDE, run GreenwayHealth.java.

**Input:**

The first line is the number K of input data sets, followed by the K data sets, each of the following form:

The first line of each data set contains the number 2 <= D <= 7 of denominations, and the number 2 <= N
<= 10 of the item’s different prices. 

On the next line are D −1 positive integers, where the i th integer specifies the number of notes of denomination i + 1 that are equivalent to 1 note of denomination i.

This is followed by N lines, each one specifying a price in terms of the quantity of notes of each
denomination. 

Each line contains D non-negative integers, where the ith integer specifies the number of notes of denomination i. 

**Output:**

For each data set, output “Data Set x:” on a line by itself, where x is its number. On the next line, output
the difference between the highest price and the lowest price, in terms of the smallest denomination.
Each data set should be followed by a blank line.
